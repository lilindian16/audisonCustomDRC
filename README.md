## Audison DRC Interface Project

Welcome to the project. The aim is to reverse engineer the Audison DRC and create a custom version of it. The end-goal is to have a unit that stays tucked inside the dashboard. We will use potentiometers to control the main volume and subwoofer volume on the fly. Additional controls can be access with a web interface - I'm thinking an ESP32 to make life easy.

These are the required steps for the project:

 - [ ] Teardown of the DRC. Work out the basic electronics and schema 
 - [ ] Snoop on the DRC interface with the main DSP unit 
 - [ ] Create a prototype using a breadboard. Verify functionality 
 - [ ] Create a PCB and housing to replace the DRC with our version
